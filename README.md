## ðŸš€ What We Do

Lapser is developing a connected ecosystem for motorsport.  
Our focus is on **team collaboration, performance tracking, and data-driven decision-making**, supported by simple automation where it matters most.

Weâ€™re creating a platform that brings together:

- **Teams** â€” manage members, entries, and performance in one place.  
- **Drivers** â€” build profiles, track progress, and compare results.  
- **Venues** â€” connect timing and event data directly into the ecosystem.  
- **Technology** â€” APIs and integrations that link everything seamlessly.  

Payments and subscriptions are part of the foundation, but Lapserâ€™s real goal is to connect people, data, and racing experiences under one platform.
